# Terminal Portfolio

Welcome to my **Terminal Portfolio**! This is an interactive, command-line-style portfolio that showcases my skills, projects, and personality through a retro terminal interface. Inspired by the amazing work of [Sat Naing]([https://github.com/satnaing]), this project is my take on a CLI-based portfolio experience.

## About the Project
This Terminal Portfolio is a creative way to present my profile. Built as an interactive CLI, it lets users explore my work by typing commands. This project was heavily inspired by [Sat Naing's Terminal Portfolio]([https://github.com/satnaing/terminal-portfolio]), and Iâ€™ve adapted it to reflect my own journey as a developer passionate about cyber defense.
